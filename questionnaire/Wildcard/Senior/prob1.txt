Our hero Alladin is on a mission to rescue Jasmine. He comes by a locked door which can be opened only by a combination of numbers. These special numbers are called 
"Perfect Numbers". A Perfect Number is a number whose sum of factors is twice the number.
For Example :
6 (1+2+3+6 = 2*6),
28 (1+2+4+7+14+28=2*28)
 
Genie uses his magic to find the upper limit of the numbers. Help Alladin find all the perfect numbers less than equal to the maximum limit told by Genie.

Input : 
First line contains test cases T.
Next T lines contains the upper limit told by Genie(say L).

Output:
For every test case output the sum of all the perfect numbers (inclusive the limit).

Example:

Input:
3
6 
32
2

Output:
6
34
0

Constraints:
1<= T <=100  , 1<= L <=10000
