Abismal is trying to break into Agrabah Database and steal information. It is now up to us to stop this attack. Fortunately our defense mechanisms have traced the attacks to their source. The fastest way to stop the attacks is to disable the source. So all we need to do is to teach that guy a lesson, by planting a virus in his own system. But before we can do that, we need to break through all the layers of the security he has put around himself. Our sources tell us that the first layer is based on ASCII encryption. We must penetrate through this layer as fast as we can to reach the source. To reach the source the character with the average ascii value of the given word is used.
Assume that the word contains only lower case letters and if average is non integer consider only integral part.

Input:

The first line will consist of the total number of test cases T. The next T lines will consist of one string on each line.The length of the string should be greater than 3.

Output:

For each test case, output is a single character.

Example: 

Input:
3
abcd
reverse
gear

Output:
b
m
g

Constraints:
Maximum Size of the words can be 5000.
