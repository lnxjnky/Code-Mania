==================
Medium Problem 1
==================

Humpty visited his grandfather's Mango farm in his summer vacations. The farm is of a grid shape (i.e. N X M matrix)  where every tree is planted row wise.
Each tree has certain number of mangoes in it. His grandfather gave him a task to collect mangoes from the trees but the constraint is he can move either right or down ( Assume that his initial position is at (1,1) ).
Help Humpty to get maximum number of Mangoes.


Input:
First line will contain the test cases (T).
Each test case will contain the value of N and M.
Next N lines  will contain M integers ( i.e the number of Mangoes in the tree).

Ouput :
Print T lines where each line will contain the maximum number of Mangoes Humpty can collect.

For Example :

Input :
2
2 2
2 3
0 1
3 3
2 5 1
6 8 2
4 0 7

Output :
6
25
