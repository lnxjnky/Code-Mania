Hard Problem 2
==============

You are given an expression consisiting of n terms T1,T2,T3...Tn. Your task is to find the number of ways in which the expression can be evaluated without altering the order of the terms in the expression.

In case of 4 terms, the different ways are

(((T1.T2).T3).T4)
((T1.T2).(T3.T4))
(T1.((T2.T3).T4))
(T1.(T2.(T3.T4)))
((T1.(T2.T3)).T4)

So the required answer would be 5.

Input
First line contains the number of test cases t (<=10)
Each of the next t lines contain a single integer n (<=1000) denoting the number of terms

Output
Display t lines each containing the number of ways modulo 10000 in which the expression can be evaluated without altering the order of the terms in the expression

Example

Input
3
3
4
5


Output
2
5
14
