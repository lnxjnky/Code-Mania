In Republic day parade tanks are to be shown. The tanks have been assigned a serial number which denotes the order in which they are supposed to move. But the organiser messed up the order of the tanks. Now its is the duty of the Commander Humpty to bring the tanks in serial order â€Œon the parade before the audience gets to see it. Coincidently there is a "Single lane " road before the Audience sitting begins. Whenever Humpty finds the tank which is not in correct serial order he redirects it to the single lane road and puts it back on the parade when its order comes. A tank cant come out from the lane if there is a tank in front of it.
You have to tell whether Commander Humpty be able to host a successful parade.

Input :
First line will contain the number of test cases (T)
Each test case will contain number of tanks in the parade ( say N).
Now N numbers denote the order in which the organiser has arranged the tanks.

For each test case print "Yes"  if Humpty can host a successful show  else print "No".

For Example:
Input:
2
5
5 2 3 1 4
5
5 2 4 1 3

Output :
Yes
No

Explanation:
For First test case :
Tank 4 is inserted in the lane ,1 moves ahead, 3 is inserted in lane in front of 4, 2 moves ahead, 3 comes out of the lane followed by 4 and the 5 moves.
For 2nd test case :
3 is inserted in the lane,1 move ahead, 4 is inserted,2 moves ahead, now 3 cant come out of the lane since 4 is in front of it.
