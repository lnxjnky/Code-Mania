Aladdin was on a romantic date with Jasmine. Having nothing better to do Genie joined them (more of like a nuisance). To get rid of him and continue his romantic evening Aladdin handed Genie a tiresome task. He gave him a word consisting of letters A-Z and a-z and asked him to count all the anagrams that can be genrated with the help of the letters of the word taken "k" at a time. Like a naive Genie started generating all the anagrams, but soon got bored(even Genies get bored, sometimes :P). He came to you for his rescue.
Assume word will not contain any repition of letters of same case.

Input:
First line contains test cases T.
Next T lines contains the word told to Genie and the value of k.

Output:
For every test case output the number of anagrams formed by taking k letters at a time.
Since the number can be very large print your answer as modulus of (10^9+7).

Example:

Input:
2
AladDin 5 
GeniE 1

Output:
2520
5

Constraints:
1<= T <=100  , 1<= word length <=52.
