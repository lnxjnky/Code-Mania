1.Dumpty plays first and the two players alternate. 

2.In his/her turn ,a player can subtract from N any prime number(including 1) less than N.The number thus obtained is the new N. 

3.The person who cannot make a move in his/her turn loses the game. 

Assuming both play optimally,who wins the game ?

Input:

The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the next lines contains an integer N.

Sample Input:
2

2


Sample Output:
Humpty
