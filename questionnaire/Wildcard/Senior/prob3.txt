As usual Abu and Lago are fighting again but in a new way. Abu speaks a number 'A' and to reply Abu Lago speaks another number 'B'. The relation between two numbers is that sum of the squares of each number is a special number. Genie tries to find the special number. But he may have made a mistake while doing the calculations. Your task is to check whether the special number found by Genie can be represented as a sum of square of two numbers.

Input:

Next T lines contains the number calculated by Genie(say N).

Output:

Example:

Input:
2
26
7

Output:
Yes
No


Constraints:
