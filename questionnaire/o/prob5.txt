==================
HARD PROBLEM - 1
==================

The year is 5000 AD and you have decided to move to a planet named Futura. So far there exist S settlements on the planet, some of them connected with one-way channels. The Chancellor of Futura has decided to set up transporters to provide a shortcut passage to travel to the Earth. The cost of setting up a transporter in each settlement is given. However, there may not be a need to build the same in every settlement. The only requirement is that every settlement must be reachable from some transporter using channels.

The chancellor wants the average cost of transporters to be as low as possible.


INPUT FORMAT

First line contains T, the number of test cases.

Each test cases begins with S, the no. of settlements (S<=50).

It is followed by a line containing S positive integers, where integer i represents the cost of building a transporter in the settlement i.

This line is followed by a SxS grid G, representing the layout of the channel. If G[i][j] is 'Y', it implies that there is a channel from settlement i to j, and 'N' implies there is not.


OUTPUT FORMAT

T lines each printing the lowest average possible average cost (6 decimal places) of building transporters in the given case.
