Hard Problem 2
==============


Alpha was moving in the corridor of his new college. He realised that he was taking steps of certain fixed sizes only. Then he pondered over the thought that in how many ways he can move from one point to another(by taking steps of diffrent sizes). Help him to compute the solution of his problem quickly.

Input

First line contains an integer n(<=100) denoting the number of diffrent size of steps that Alpha can take
Next line contain n integers denoting the value of step sizes.
Next line contains the integer m(<=100) denoting the number of queries
Next m lines each containing a single integer k(<=200) denoting the distance from his initial point to end point.

Output
Print m lines denoting the number of ways in which Alpha can move from one point to another. In case if he cannot move from one point to another print 0

Example
Input
3
1 3 5
2
3
5

Output
2
3

Explanation
3 can formed in 2 ways (1,1,1),(3)
5 can be formed in 3 ways (1,1,1,1,1) (1,1,3) (5)

The different permutations are to be treated as single like (1,1,3) and (3,1,1) is same
